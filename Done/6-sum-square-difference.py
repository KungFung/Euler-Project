'''The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
    1^2 + 2^" + ... + 10^2 = 385.
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
    (1+2+3+...+10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum.'''
